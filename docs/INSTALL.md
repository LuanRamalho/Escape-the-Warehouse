## Install the Game 

- Download the [ZIP](https://github.com/CrowStudio/Escape-The-Werehouse-/archive/master.zip) and extract it in a location of your choice.<br><br>
- Install [Python](https://python.org) and/or [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org)<br>
  >...**Use python 3.7.7** or greater, because it is much friendlier to newbies, and additionally runs faster.<br>
  ><br>The best way to install pygame is with the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) tool (which is what python uses to install packages).<br>
  >Note, this comes with python in recent versions. We use the --user flag to tell it to install into the<br>
  >home directory, rather than globally.<br>
  >```
  >python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
  >```
  >To see if it works, run one of the included examples:
  >```
  >python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
  >```

If it doesn't work, more platform-specific instructions can be found [HERE](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

To run the game type:
```
python3 escape_the_warehouse.py
```
